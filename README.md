"yet another photo screen saver" displays lots of photos on the screen at one time

Dozens of images from Flickr and your disk are displayed on the screen, organized in a grid-like layout. As photos are partially covered up, the remaining parts get replaced with smaller photos. The screen saver follows a methodical, rhythmic progression.
